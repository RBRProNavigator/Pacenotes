# RBRPro Pacenotes

This repository is were RBRPro pacenotes creators release their pacenotes. They are divided by author and (sometimes) surface wetness.
The pacenotes will work with every codriver. However some of them could be optimized for a specific codriver.

# Usage

Cick on the green button above and choose "Download ZIP". Or click on a release link on the right and download it.
Once you opened the zip file, place the files you want to try in the RBRPRo\Addons\Navigator\personal-logs folder

The pacenotes files are numbered by track code. To know the track code you can use the search feature in the manager. you can search by name using the top right text box, write in the name (a partial name is good) and click on the magnifier lens icon. The track code is the number marked in red. For example for the "Fernet Branca" stage, the track code is 544. This means that the pacenotes file for this stage is 544.cdrvlog
